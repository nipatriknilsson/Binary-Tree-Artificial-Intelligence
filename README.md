## Artificial Intelligence using a binary tree

This Javascript code demonstrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) using a Node Express server and a client webbrowser. The AI is built with a binary tree.

The goal of the AI is to guess what animal you are thinking about. When the database is empty, the question is "Is it a dog?". There is no rebuilding of the binary tree, so thinking of broader questions before specific are a good idea.
